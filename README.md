# CODE_game_snake

The idea was about a snake, or a snake monster in space trying to eat the star. 
But the orbit of stars are often very fast, that's why the snake have to be very fast, not only to eat the star but also to avoid hitting the wall (the end of the universe)
The player have to control the snake with UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT buttons.
When the snake eat one star, the score +1 (start with 0), the high score will be save. 
When someone start playing, he/she need to press ENTER button to play, and press Q button to quit.
when the snake die, the game will go back to the Menu.
